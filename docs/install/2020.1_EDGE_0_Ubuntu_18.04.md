Install to Ubuntu 18.04 or Debian 10
---------------------------------------------------------------------

### Download

```console
shell$ git clone --depth 1 --branch 2020.1_EDGE_0_Ubuntu_18.04 https://github.com/ikwzm/ZynqMP-FPGA-XRT.git
```

### Preparing for installation

please install python-pyopencl before installing XRT.

```console
shell$ sudo apt install -y python-pyopencl
```

If this package is not installed, it will try to install pyopencl with pip when installing xrt_202010.2.6.0_Ubuntu_18.04-arm64-xrt.deb.
To install pyopencl with pip, you had to compile a program written in C, and the installation failed due to various troubles.
Installing pyopencl pre-built for Debian/Ubuntu from the beginning will save you trouble.

### Install XRT Debian Package

Install xrt_202010.2.6.0_Ubuntu_18.04-arm64-xrt.deb with the apt command.
When installing this package, build the zocl kernel module using the dkms mechanism during the process. Therefore, installation takes time.
